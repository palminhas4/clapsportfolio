## Our Approach

Our data science methodology follows these principles:

1.  **Problem-First**: We begin with a clear problem statement before diving into data collection
2.  **Iterative Analysis**: We develop solutions incrementally, refining our approach based on findings
3.  **Reproducible Research**: All code and documentation is version-controlled and well-documented
4.  **Ethical Consideration**: We prioritize privacy, bias mitigation, and responsible use of algorithms
5.  **Effective Communication**: Results are presented in accessible formats for technical and non-technical audiences
