## Our Approach

Our data science methodology follows these principles:

1. **Problem-First**: We begin with a clear problem statement before diving into data collection
2. **Iterative Analysis**: We develop solutions incrementally, refining our approach based on findings
3. **Reproducible Research**: All code and documentation is version-controlled and well-documented
4. **Ethical Consideration**: We prioritize privacy, bias mitigation, and responsible use of algorithms
5. **Effective Communication**: Results are presented in accessible formats for technical and non-technical audiences
